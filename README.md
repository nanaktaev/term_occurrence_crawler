## What does it do?
- This crawler counts terms occurrence on a web page and child pages linked with it.
- You can specify terms and page to start from in the 'change properties' menu. Here you can also set max page visits, max page depth and other crawling options.
- When the crawling process will be finished you will find two new .csv files inside the 'results' folder. One contains unsorted results for all visited pages, another contains results for only top ten pages (by all terms).
